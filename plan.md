# Rendering

## MVP

Engine that is capable of making tic tac toe using multiple underlying frameworks.

### Plan

1. Implement tic tac toe entirely on pixel_rendermaster
2. Now we start moving all things related to game itself (including asset loading) to game
2. Do it until you can edit the tic tac toe game entirely on game folder
